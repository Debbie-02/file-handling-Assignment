# file-handling-Assignment
python assignment wk4

This is a Python program that demonstrates file handling and exception handling.The program:
Asks the user for a filename.
Reads the contents of the file.
Modifies the content (converts it to uppercase).
Writes the modified content into a new file.
Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist, cannot be read, or other unexpected issues occur.

 Features
